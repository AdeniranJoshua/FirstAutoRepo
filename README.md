Racing Exercise
* The estimate for this ticket will be 8 points
* This exercise has been completed to the best of my knowledge there are things I had not implemented before which I had to learn the basics for this exercise, lots more to know & understand.
Among them is working with wdio,yarn,chai,creating a github account so I could repro my work to you.
Issues with Sourcetree and github are reasons why it was not delivered on time.
Please see the read.md file on the best way to run the test.
